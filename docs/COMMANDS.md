# Command reference

User-visible flags for each implemented `tl` command. For canonical per-command behavior, read the matching file in [`../features/`](../features); the feature file wins if this page drifts. Every command also accepts
`--help` at the terminal.

Global flags:

```
    --color              When to use ANSI color (auto|never|always) [default: auto]
```

`NO_COLOR` disables ANSI color. JSON output never includes color.

---

## `tl init`

Initialize a `.taskledger/` ledger in the current directory.

```
(no flags)
```

## `tl create [title] [options]`

Create a new task. The title is a required positional argument or passed via
`--title`. Human output colorizes the created task identifier when color is enabled.

```
    --title              Task title (required, or positional argument)
-d, --description        Task description (stored under ## Description)
-p, --priority           Task priority (l|low, m|medium, h|high) [default: medium]
-t, --type               Task type
    --tag                Tag to apply (repeatable)
    --actor              Creator actor [default: human]
    --json               Emit JSON output
```

## `tl list`

List active tasks in the ledger, sorted by priority then identifier. Closed
statuses (`done`, `cancelled`) are hidden by default. Passing `--status`
with a closed status reveals matching tasks without needing `--all`. Human
output includes `ID`, `Status`, `Priority`, `Claimed By`, and `Title`.
When color is enabled, priority values are colored (`high` red, `medium` yellow, `low` blue), and `--all` dims closed-task rows.

```
-a, --all                Include closed tasks (done and cancelled)
    --status             Only show tasks with this status (e.g. pending_human, blocked)
    --tag                Only show tasks carrying this tag
    --claimed-by         Only show tasks claimed by this actor
    --mine               Shortcut for --claimed-by <resolved actor>
    --json               Emit JSON output
```

## `tl show TASK_ID`

Show a task in detail. Human output includes the identifier, title, status,
priority, dependencies, claim state, and Markdown body content such as notes.
When color is enabled, field labels are dimmed, field values are bold,
status/priority values are colorized, and Markdown headings in the body are bright blue.
Accepts both full IDs (`task-k5g`) and bare short codes (`k5g`).

```
    --json               Emit JSON output
```

## `tl ready`

List tasks that are ready to be claimed. A task is ready when it is `open`
(or `in_progress` with an expired claim), all dependencies are `done`, and
no active claim exists.

Use `--tag` to narrow the queue to a role-ish dimension (review, docs,
arch, etc.). See [`../.decisions/0001-multi-agent-coordination-via-tags.md`](../.decisions/0001-multi-agent-coordination-via-tags.md)
for the rationale.

```
    --tag                Only show tasks carrying this tag
    --json               Emit JSON output
```

## `tl claim TASK_ID`

Claim a task with a time-limited lease. Sets status to `in_progress` and
records claim expiry. Rejects if another actor holds an active claim (exit
5) or dependencies are unmet (exit 4). Uses the same actor resolution chain
as `note`.

Re-running `tl claim` as the same actor extends the lease — this is the
heartbeat pattern for long-running work. Use `--force` to take over an
active claim held by a different actor.

```
    --actor              Claiming actor (optional; auto-resolved if unset)
    --ttl                Lease duration, e.g. 60m or 2h (default from config)
    --force              Take over an active claim held by a different actor
    --json               Emit JSON output
```

## `tl dep add TASK_ID --on TASK_ID`

Add a dependency link between tasks. Both tasks must exist (exit 3 if not).
Idempotent — adding the same dependency twice is a no-op.

```
    --on                 Target task to depend on (required)
```

## `tl dep remove TASK_ID --on TASK_ID`

Remove a dependency link. Both tasks must exist (exit 3 if not).
Idempotent — removing a non-existent dependency is a no-op.

```
    --on                 Target task to drop as a dependency (required)
```

## `tl note TASK_ID`

Append a timestamped note to a task's body under a `## Notes` section. Notes
are the human-facing audit trail — use them for progress updates, handoff
context, and decision records.

```
-m, --message            Note message (required)
    --actor              Actor writing the note (optional; auto-resolved)
```

## `tl close TASK_ID`

Mark a task as `done`. Unclaimed open tasks may be closed by any actor.
Claimed tasks may be closed by the claiming actor, or by another actor with
`--force`. Rejects blocked and already-done tasks.

```
    --actor              Actor closing the task (optional; auto-resolved)
    --force              Close even when another actor holds an active claim
    --json               Emit JSON output
```

## `tl cancel TASK_ID -m "<reason>"`

Mark a task as `cancelled`. Use when work will not be completed —
superseded, duplicated, no-longer-needed — so the audit trail records
intentional abandonment rather than falsely claiming completion. A reason
is required and stored as a note. Cancelling a claimed task releases the
claim; another actor's active claim requires `--force`. Rejects already
`done` and already `cancelled` tasks.

```
-m, --message            Cancellation reason (required, stored as a note)
    --actor              Actor cancelling the task (optional; auto-resolved)
    --force              Cancel even when another actor holds an active claim
    --json               Emit JSON output
```

## `tl release TASK_ID`

Voluntarily release a claim on a task, returning it to `open`. Only the
claiming actor may release unless `--force` is used.

```
    --actor              Actor releasing the claim (optional; auto-resolved)
    --force              Release even when another actor holds the claim
    --json               Emit JSON output
```

## `tl block TASK_ID -m "<blocker>"`

Mark a task `blocked` and record the blocking condition as a note. Use for
external blockers (waiting on upstream, infra down, third-party fix) —
distinct from `pending_human`, which is "I need an answer". Blocking a
claimed task releases the claim so others can see it is not actively being
worked.

```
-m, --message            Blocker description (required, stored as a note)
    --actor              Actor reporting the blocker (optional; auto-resolved)
    --json               Emit JSON output
```

## `tl unblock TASK_ID`

Clear the `blocked` status and return the task to `open` so it becomes
eligible for the ready queue again. Rejects tasks that are not blocked.

```
    --actor              Actor clearing the blocker (optional; auto-resolved)
    --json               Emit JSON output
```

## `tl history [TASK_ID]`

Print events recorded in `.taskledger/events.jsonl`. With a `TASK_ID`,
filters to that task's audit trail. With `--since <duration>`, filters to
events within the given window (e.g. `24h`, `7d`) across all tasks —
useful for "what did the team do today?" review. At least one of
`TASK_ID` or `--since` is required.

```
    --since              Only show events within this duration (e.g. 24h, 7d)
    --json               Emit JSON output (array of raw event objects)
```

## `tl stale`

List tasks whose claims have expired. Use before `tl release --force` to
clean up abandoned claims.

```
    --json               Emit JSON output
```

## `tl pending TASK_ID`

Mark a task `pending_human` with a question. The claim is released so the
task is visible as awaiting input. Stores the question and requester in the
task frontmatter.

```
-q, --question          Question for the human (required)
    --actor             Actor requesting human input (optional; auto-resolved)
    --json              Emit JSON output
```

## `tl agents`

Print a recommended `AGENTS.md` snippet for TaskLedger-aware agents. By
default, writes only to stdout and never edits files for you. Commands in the
snippet are formatted as Markdown code spans, for example `tl ready --json`.

With `--update`, append or refresh a marked TaskLedger workflow block in
existing agent instruction files: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `GEMINI.md`.
Missing files are not created.

```
    --update            Append or refresh the workflow block in existing agent instruction files
```
---

## Setup errors

Commands that need ledger state are non-interactive for agent safety. If
`.taskledger/` is missing, they exit with code `1` and print:

```text
TaskLedger is not initialized in this repository.
Run `tl init` from the repository root to create .taskledger/.
```

## Lock contention

Mutating commands acquire an advisory `flock(2)` on `.taskledger/.lock` for
the duration of the read-modify-write. If another `tl` process holds the
lock for more than 5 seconds, the command exits with code `7` and reports
the contention. Re-run the command; the underlying race that exit code 7
protects against (two agents both succeeding on the same `tl claim`, lost
notes from concurrent writers) does not occur.
