## Description

The tl agents snippet (cmd/agents_snippet.md) has several content issues:

1. 'Do not begin implementation from chat instructions alone if there is no matching tl task' — too rigid, fights real workflow. Reword to guide rather than forbid.
2. No mention of --actor flag. Agents that can't set env vars need --actor on each call. Add examples of both patterns (TL_ACTOR env vs --actor flag).
3. 'check the current @implemented set with make bdd before relying on them' — leaks implementation detail into agent workflow. Remove or replace with a simple 'tl <cmd> --help to verify availability.'
4. Missing commands: tl history <id> (mentioned in steps but should be listed explicitly), tl dep add/remove, tl stale, tl unblock, tl resolve.
5. Step 1 says 'run tl show <task-id> and tl history <task-id>' but 'history' is missing from the command listing in Step 6's preamble.
6. No context-economy mode — snippet is ~70 lines. Consider adding --compact flag (separate task scope, but the base snippet should be tighter).

See the critical review in session history for full context.

## Notes

- 2026-05-31T09:32:25Z [pi] note: Revised agents snippet to use explicit --actor agent-name examples, soften task-start guidance, remove make bdd/@implemented leak, add handoff/reference context, and document history/dep/stale/unblock/resolve commands. Updated agents feature expectations, BDD code-span checks, and usage docs. Validation: gofmt, make bdd, make test passed.
