Feature: List ready tasks
  As an agent picking up work
  I want to see which open tasks are unblocked and unclaimed
  So that I can choose what to work on next safely

  Background:
    Given an initialized TaskLedger repository

  Scenario: An open task with no dependencies is ready
    Given a task "task-abc123" with status "open" and no dependencies
    When the agent runs `tl ready`
    Then the ready output contains "task-abc123"

  Scenario: An open task whose dependencies are all done is ready
    Given a task "task-def456" with status "done"
    And a task "task-abc123" with status "open"
    And "task-abc123" depends on "task-def456"
    When the agent runs `tl ready`
    Then the ready output contains "task-abc123"

  Scenario: An open task with a not-done dependency is not ready
    Given a task "task-def456" with status "open"
    And a task "task-abc123" with status "open"
    And "task-abc123" depends on "task-def456"
    When the agent runs `tl ready`
    Then the ready output does not contain "task-abc123"

  Scenario: A blocked task is not ready
    Given a task "task-abc123" with status "blocked"
    When the agent runs `tl ready`
    Then the ready output does not contain "task-abc123"

  Scenario: A task awaiting human input is not ready
    Given a task "task-abc123" with status "pending_human"
    When the agent runs `tl ready`
    Then the ready output does not contain "task-abc123"

  Scenario: A claimed in-progress task is not ready
    Given a task "task-abc123" claimed by "claude-code:main" with an active lease
    When the agent runs `tl ready`
    Then the ready output does not contain "task-abc123"

  Scenario: The ready queue can be retrieved as JSON
    Given a task "task-abc123" titled "Add login form validation" with status "open" and no dependencies
    When the agent runs `tl ready --json`
    Then the JSON output is an array containing a task with identifier "task-abc123"
    And the JSON output contains title "Add login form validation"
    And the JSON output contains a priority for "task-abc123"
