Feature: Show a single task in detail
  As a developer or agent
  I want to inspect a specific task
  So that I can understand its full state before acting on it

  Background:
    Given an initialized TaskLedger repository

  Scenario: Showing a task prints its identifier, title, status, dependencies, claim, and notes
    Given a task "task-abc123" titled "Add login form validation" with status "open"
    And "task-abc123" depends on "task-def456"
    And "task-abc123" has a note from "claude-code:frontend" saying "Looked at the existing form."
    When the developer runs `tl show task-abc123`
    Then the output contains identifier "task-abc123"
    And the output contains title "Add login form validation"
    And the output contains status "open"
    And the output contains dependency "task-def456"
    And the output contains the note from "claude-code:frontend"

  Scenario: Showing a task with JSON output returns the full task object
    Given a task "task-abc123" titled "Add login form validation" with status "open"
    When the developer runs `tl show task-abc123 --json`
    Then the JSON output contains identifier "task-abc123"
    And the JSON output contains title "Add login form validation"
    And the JSON output contains status "open"

  Scenario: Showing a task that does not exist is rejected
    Given no task with identifier "task-zzz999" exists
    When the developer runs `tl show task-zzz999`
    Then the command exits with code 3
    And the output reports that "task-zzz999" was not found
